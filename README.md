# Energy_consumption_prediection_IoT_ML


Smart electricity metering devices advancing by the years allow us to get consumption data on a daily and hourly basis at extraordinary accuracies. With more and more devices making their way into our life our homes have transformed into smart homes. Energy usage and predictability of energy consumption are major parts of sustainable energy usage. Through this project we plan to predict household electricity consumption based on weather conditions and smart home appliances. In this project we are going to implement a predictive analysis of electricity consumption in smart houses based on appliances in the house and the weather conditions of the surroundings using machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and neural networks. We will compare the accuracy of the predictions of Linear Regression and neural networks. For our experiment we have taken the data set related to our project from Kaggle. We also identify and predict patterns in the data using data visualisation. The machine learning algorithms have been implemented in python. 

Steps:
First the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed. Then, feature engineering was performed and this data was prepared for giving as input to a model. Then the model was built and its training history was plotted to see its performance.
